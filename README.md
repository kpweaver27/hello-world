# hello-world
First repository
Hello everybody, I have joined github after graduating from Indiana University with a New Media Communications degree. I only took two web design classes for the degree, but I really enjoyed what I did and want to continue learning, hopefully moving into the profession of web design or coding. I am a career changer after a short career in the culinary field. I am currently working as a radio technician where I test bluetooth and voice recognition features, but my coworkers with more coding experience are writing automation codes for those functions. I have written four full pages including my portfolio page www.weaverwebworks.com so I am fairly comfortable with the basics of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I would like to reinforce those abilities before I take that into the more creative jQuery and Bootstrap as well as the more technical PHP and MySQL languages. Anyone can contact me at kpweaver27@gmail.com if needed.
